# INTELLISTORE
Welcome to IntelliStore! This store will prepare you for the summer with fun and fresh items for you to use on the beach!

## The test

### Getting started

In order to start, please clone this repository with 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Talentrator/IntelliStore-Angular
```
On Github, create a *private* repository. In order to add this to your local git, run
```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_github_username>/<your_private_repository_name>
```
In order for us to be able to rate your submission, please add "@wittmaxi" and "@calleuz" as contributors. You will be guided through the next steps by the test you are currently participating in on talentrator.com

### Your Tasks

1) Display all store elements: \
    the elements are defined as `items` in `app.component.ts` \
    make sure that adding elements in the array also displays them on the website without needing additional code
3) Pick a better set of Colors for the page \
    and integrate them with Bootstrap
4) Design the page: \
    The page is still very rough. You may change everything that is displayed \
    as long as it does not completely change the identity of the page
